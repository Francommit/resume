career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Regardless of my job title, my favorite part of being in the fintech industry is being able to work alongside teams of people who enjoy working on creative solutions. DevOps fits me well as I enjoy automating everything and anything.
      
      Project teams are often abundantly full of manual build and deployment processes, which I am more than happy to automate. Using cutting edge technologies makes the automation process even more fun and drives me to do what I do best.
